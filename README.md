# Ignite Plugin Registry

## Why is this archived?

We really appreciate all the community support in the years since we first released ignite-plugins. Our focus has shifted to the latest version of [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite), which does not have a plugin-based architecture ([read more here](https://shift.infinite.red/introducing-ignite-4-0-flame-1dfc891f9966)). Feel free to fork this library and continue on its legacy if you want. 

This is the official Ignite 2 plugin registry that powers `ignite list`, `ignite search <plugin>`, and `ignite info <plugin>`.

If you'd like to see your plugin here please submit a PR!
